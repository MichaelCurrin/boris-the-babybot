## Get a Twitter developer account


Without a developer account, you cannot create the app tokens that the Twitter API needs for authentication. These are needed whenever you do requests such as fetch or create Twitter content.

You need to apply for a developer account on Twitter, including a written a motivation on how you will use the account. This can take a few days and a few emails to Twitter if you are not approved immediately.
